# Tutorial

Same as for my other tool, you'll find tutorial here : https://github.com/teisseire117/DeleteTweets#readme

You can ignore tweets by author name (broken currently, I'll fix this)
Or by tweet ID (this works)

I tested on my accounts and it removed 500 likes pretty fast, however for more likes I don't know what can happen. Will you get ratelimited ? If that's the case the tool should wait on its own 1 minute and retry until it works.
