# Tutorial

Same as for my other tool, you'll find tutorial here : https://github.com/teisseire117/DeleteTweets#readme

You can ignore tweets by author name (broken currently, I'll fix this)
Or by tweet ID (this works)

I tested on my accounts and it removed 900 likes then it got rate-limited, the script handles it, and after 8 minutes it resumed to unlike process. Then I got rate-limited later on again but it handles itself.

Now on my Like tab, I see no tweets liked.  However on the top bar it still says I have 490 likes but I don't know what/where they are, they are not displayed anywhere.
